## Beta pricing

Arcjet is currently in beta and is free to use.

## Future pricing

The current features available today will be unmetered and free to use. Our goal
is to help developers protect their applications so we don't want you to incur
costs if you are attacked.

Arcjet pricing will be based on the usage of features we intend to introduce in
the future e.g. organization-wide rules, geo processing restrictions, single
tenancy, compliance tools, etc.

Please [reach out](mailto:support@arcjet.com) if you have any questions about
pricing.
