This checklist is a guide to help you secure your Next.js application. It is not
exhaustive, but it covers the most important security best practices.

## Checklist

0. Are your dependencies up to date?
1. Are you validating and sanitizing data?
2. Are you using any environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`?
3. Have you guarded against server-side code being exposed to the client?
4. Have you added security headers?
5. Is security-related functionality centralized?
6. Is your code editor helping you write secure code?

## 0. Dependencies

This may seem simple, but quickly applying patches is one of the most important
ways to keep your application secure. Use a tool like
[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to
automatically get notified of new versions of your dependencies and open pull
requests to update them.

Keeping up to date with the latest versions makes it much easier to upgrade if a
security update is released. Otherwise, you may find yourself needing to work
through multiple releases to get to the latest version in a stressful situation
where a security vulnerability has been discovered.

Running [Socket](https://socket.dev/) can help assess the security of new
dependencies and identify potential supply chain risks when new updates are
released. Running `npm audit` is an alternative.

Make sure you pin your dependencies to specific versions using
`package-lock.json` or equivalent.

## 1. Data validation and sanitization

Once of the major advantages of using Next.js is that it inherits the built-in
security escaping and sanitization features of React. However, it [doesn't do
everything](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3473) and you should still
always validate data you receive from both users and APIs.

TypeScript helps with basic type checking, but that is not the same as
validating data.

Use a package like [zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) to
validate data from users and APIs. Zod has [a good comparison of the
options](https://zod.dev/?id=comparison).

If you are using an ORM like Drizzle then these can be integrated at the same
time e.g. [drizzle-zod](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/zod). API frameworks like
[tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/server/validators) also support validation.

### Watch out for

These features have their uses, but should warrant extra caution and review:

- Any use of
  [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html)
  in your application is a risk. This is a potential vector for cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks, which is why it is named "dangerous".
- Any use of
  [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).
  A better option is
  [innerText](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText),
  which does not parse HTML.

In both cases, setting the HTML directly bypasses React's built-in security. Try
to create logic within the component which can use props to build the HTML
instead rather than hard coding it.

## 2. Environment variables

Next.js [automatically loads environment
variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)
and only makes them available to server side code. To expose them to the client
you must prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

This is a good default, and means you can pay extra attention to any variables
prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to ensure they are safe to expose to the client.

If you are self-hosting Next.js or want to add an extra layer of safety to
ensure no environment variables leak into the deployed version, you can [use a
tool like Trufflehog to scan the build
artifacts](https://blog.arcjet.com/secret-scanning-and-next-js-builds/).

## 3. Server only

Server components, client components, server side rendering, server
actions...these can be confusing.

Next.js has [a video on static vs dynamic
rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2lKYy-9EJE), docs on [server actions
and
mutations](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations)
and [data fetching
patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns),
but it's too easy to accidentally expose server-side code to the client. This
can expose credentials or cause unexpected data leaks.

One way to guard against this is to tag modules with 'server-only' when you want
to guarantee they will never be used on the client. If a client component tries
to use a server-only module, the Next.js build will fail.

Just add this to the top of your module:

```ts
import "server-only";
```

This is also extra protection against accidentally exposing sensitive
environment variables.

## 4. Security headers

There are a few security headers that you should consider adding to your
application:

- [Content Security Policy
  (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) helps prevent
  cross-site scripting, malware injection, and data theft. It ensures only the
  expected content is loaded on your page. It is [recommended that you set a
  strict policy](https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp) because denying everything
  by default avoids needing an exhaustive list of allowed sources.
- [`Strict-Transport-Security`
  (HSTS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
  tells browsers your site should only be accessed over HTTPS.
- [`X-Content-Type-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options)
  prevents vulnerabilities related to content sniffing.
- Permissions-Policy: This header allows a site to control which features and
  APIs can be used in the browser.
- [`Referrer-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
  controls how much referrer information is included when navigating away from a
  page.

### Setting security headers in Next.js

The [next-safe package](https://github.com/trezy/next-safe) provides a simple
way to configure and add these security headers to Next.js. For general JS apps
and those using Express, the [Helmet
package](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) is a popular choice.

The [tldrsec/awesome-secure-defaults
repo](https://github.com/tldrsec/awesome-secure-defaults) has a list of other
useful secure-default libraries for various languages, including Node.js.

Next.js also provides [an example of how to manually set just the CSP
header](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy)
using middleware.

Once you have a CSP policy, you can evaluate it with the [CSP Evaluator tool
from Google](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/).

### Other headers

- `X-Frames-Options`: This header prevents your content from being embedded into
  other sites. It is now [part of the Content Security Policy
  specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors),
  so you can set the `frame-ancestors` directive in your CSP to achieve the same
  effect. This header is useful for [older
  browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors#browser_compatibility)
  that don't support CSP.

* `X-XSS-Protection`: This header was a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome,
  and Safari that enabled the browser's built-in XSS filter. It is [deprecated
  and should not be
  used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection).

## 5. Centralize security functions

It's a good idea to centralize security-related functionality in your
application. This makes it easier to test, review, and audit. Some examples:

- A single function for session management and authentication (AuthN). Ideally
  this is handled automatically without needing a developer to specifically call
  it - middleware is a good place for this. Clerk is a good option that
  [supports authentication
  middleware](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). Another
  alternative is
  [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#middleware), but
  their middleware doesn't support edge functions so you may need to use the
  [`getServerSession` function](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs).
- A single function for checking whether users have access to a particular
  resource (AuthZ). Similar to AuthN, this should be handled automatically
  without needing a developer to specifically call it.
  [Oso](https://www.osohq.com/) is a framework which allows modeling
  authorization controls, but you could also have a simple function that runs
  the check based on passed in parameters.

## 6. Code editor

Your code editor can help you write secure code by showing linting and static
analysis errors. Install [Trunk](https://trunk.io/) to automatically bootstrap
relevant linters and manage the configuration for you.

In particular, enable [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy),
[Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog),
[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks), and
[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) to scan your code for potential security
vulnerabilities. These can also be enabled in CI.
