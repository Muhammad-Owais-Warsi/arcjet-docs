<Aside type="note" title="env files">
  Node 20+ supports loading environment variables from a local file with
  `--env-file`. If you're using an older version of Node, you can use a package
  like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the environment
  variables from a `.env.local` file.

```sh
node --env-file .env.local index.js
```

Make a `curl` request from your terminal. You should see a `403` response
because `curl` is considered a bot by default. This [can be
customized](/bot-protection/identifying-bots).

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```

Then load `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Refresh the page a few times
to trigger the rate limit. The requests will also show up in the [Arcjet
dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
