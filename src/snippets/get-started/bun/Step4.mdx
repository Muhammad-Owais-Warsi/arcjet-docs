## 4. Start app

```bash
bun run --hot index.ts
```

Make a `curl` request from your terminal. You should see a `403` response
because `curl` is considered a bot by default. This [can be
customized](/bot-protection/identifying-bots).

```sh
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```

Then load `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Refresh the page a few times
to trigger the rate limit. You may see 2 requests - one for the page and one for
a favicon. The requests will also show up in the [Arcjet
dashboard](https://app.arcjet.com).
